## University-High School Collaboration Project: Optimizing Issues in the Community.
This project is supported by the Japan Science and Technology Agency. Its aim is to enable high school students to identify problems within their living environment and propose solutions using optimization models (e.g., MILP) and solvers (e.g., Xpress, Gurobi).

From 2019 to 2021 , I served as a TA, during which time my responsibilities included guiding a group and overseeing the following topics:

- Developing a self-study schedule program to maximize efficiency. (2021)
- Selecting evacuation shelters during disasters. (2020)
- Leveling out the number of people using the school cafeterias. (2019)
- Ease congestion by determining stops on the Tobu Isezaki Line. (2019)
